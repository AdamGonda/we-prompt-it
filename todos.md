TODO fix refeching on expore when navigateing
goto is not a good fit, use browser api to manipulate history and to update the url
because goto althoug updates the url and it's not trigger a hard refresh
but I can't listen for the appropriate event to trigger refetch 
problems
- maintin proper history
- refetch on history change
- update url on search
- keep searchbar input in sync with url
